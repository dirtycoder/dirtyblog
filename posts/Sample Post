-Your markdown goes here-

The filename for each post must follow the pattern:
YYYY-MM-DD_post-url_Post Title

As you can see, the filename consist of three section separated by an underscore. 

There is date_URL_title of each post.

All you need to do is create a file following the previous pattern and place it in the 'posts' folder.

You will also need to change the parameters in the config.py file.

You can change the location of posts using the posts_directory variable in the models.py file.

You can find more examples for markdown [here](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/) and [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
