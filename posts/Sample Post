-Your markdown goes here-

Each post should have a Date, URL, Title and Content tags.

All you need to do is create a file with the previous tags and place it in the 'posts' folder.

You will also need to change the parameters in the config.py file.

You can change the location of posts using the posts_directory variable in the models.py file.

You can find more examples for markdown [here](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/) and [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

And look at this cute kitten... :)
